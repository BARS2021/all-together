          Paula Mans (b. 1986) is a self-taught painter, collagist, and art educator based in Washington, DC. While Paula is a native Washingtonian, she spent many of the formative years of her childhood and young adulthood living abroad in Tanzania, Mozambique, Eswatini, and Brazil. Her experiences throughout the African Diaspora shaped her identity and informed the development of her artistic voice. Living in Washington, DC and Salvador, Brazil has been particularly impactful for the artist. Both cities are Diasporian meccas for Black cultural expression. DC (often referred to as Chocolate City) and Salvador (frequently called Roma Negra, or Black Rome in Portuguese) are famous for their prominent and influential Black populations. Nonetheless, racism and gentrification often render Black people invisible in both cities. In her artistic practice, Paula Mans seeks to create work that deconstructs these pervasive power structures by amplifying the visibility and agency of the Black figure.

          For the longest time, I have been looking for a way to voice my perception of the things occurring around me. I’m a very detail oriented person and in being so, I find my viewership of specific experiences or moments somewhat clouded. This image was created when I first began stepping back. I remember conversing with my grandmother about black perseverance throughout history and the idea of how black creativity, intelligence and grace kept developing countering those times. She summarized it into “black people make struggle look good” and that saying changed my perception of everything. This image highlights an unwelcome spotlight that’s been placed on the black community. Utilizing pretty fabric and even the time of day(“golden hour”) to create an aesthetically pleasing artwork. I wanted to create an image from the viewer’s perception. You can infer what kind of relationship is in motion here with the gate separating the subject from its viewer(us).

          Introduced to photography in 2016, Price witnessed the rapid effects of gentrification around her and felt moved to document its progression so that her fellow DC natives could read a story told by one of their own. But it wasn't until she dreamt of the four black boys with royal blue eyes that her documentation grew from pure interest to powerful storytelling. The dream's subjects rose from the grounds of a historic black community in Washington, DC. Price recollects the boys spoke in a sound language, gifting her a camera and then returning underground. She realized her dream of the "blue-eyed black boys" was a divine assignment to pick up her camera and visually explore adolescence and the black boy experience in Washington, DC. She uses the camera to highlight the youth's beauty, innocence, dignity, plight against stereotypes, and longing for solutions.

          Between a diva and an anti-diva, Sydney Vernon spans from painting and drawing to video and performance. Mixing herself and her family history with elements of contemporary culture like magazine clippings and found images, Vernon explores universal concepts while making artworks that trigger your emotions. Tapping into both expression and representation and the tradition of Black abstraction, Vernon’s paintings possess intimate yet extremely powerful energy. In her own words “With my work, I want people to understand how everything I do is connected to living as a Black woman, living in the Internet age, living in the wake of slavery and living in culture while simultaneously trying to create it.”

          Born and raised in the DMV, I’ve been painting and drawing for basically all my life and taking inspiration from all the different aspects of black womanhood I grew up recognizing. I’ve always grown up in environments thriving with black folk in their respective communities although I moved around the state quite a bit, but I found comfort and community in the Baltimore art scene while attending high school. I attend Maryland Institute College of Art currently entering my junior year, majoring in General Fine Arts.
