        Drawing inspiration from Black Unicorn, a collection of poems by Audre Lorde, All Together is an exhibition featuring Black women-identifying artists whose work explores themes of race, gender, and sexuality. The exhibition highlights the artist's personal experiences and observations, while also making assertions on the past, present, and future of Black womanhood and girlhood. The colorful artworks are intended to engage viewers aesthetically while underscoring Black womenâ€™s self-determined spirit to persist. Similar to the collection of poems by Audre Lorde, the artworks in All Together explore African spirituality, ancestral veneration, and consider the ways vulnerability and optimism appear in the liberation of Black women.
